                Professor GN Saibaba's Death Is A Wake-Up Call To Prevent Abuse Of UAPA Against Dissenters.
                A person who took up cause of human rights, lived with 90% disability and relied on a wheelchair for
                mobility, had many physical problems, had surgeries but denied bali all the time, the judiciary always
                worked according to orders coming from BJP headquarters. He even denied parole to attend the funeral of
                his mother. JUST BECAUSE HIS SOCIAL ACTIVISM DISPLEASED THE ESTABLISHMENT.
                country where rapists and murderers and rioters with political patronage get parole , rapists and
                murderers geot garlanded and remission at the drop of a hat, the denial of the basic rights to those
                persecuted for 'thought-crimes' should trouble anyone with a conscience.
                No one will forget Pandu Pora Narote and stan Swamy's death. UMAR is still in Jail
                This is the wake-up call for meaningful reforms to prevent the misuse (THE MISUSE OF UAPA) of draconian
                laws against dissenters.
                â€œI hope none of you should feel sympathetic to my condition. I don't believe in sympathy, I only believe
                in solidarity. I intended to tell you my story only because I believe that it is also your story. Also
                because I believe my freedom is your freedom."- Why do you fear my way so much?Poems and Letters from
                Prison, G.N Saibaba
